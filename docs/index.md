# ðŸ§­ Project Architecture Documentation

Welcome to the architecture documentation for our web application platform. This documentation follows the [arc42](https://arc42.org) template, which provides a structured way to communicate architecture decisions, system design, and technical rationale.

This system consists of:
- A **React-based Single Page Application (SPA)**
- Multiple **Quarkus-based microservices**
- Centralized authentication via **Keycloak**
- Deployments supported through **Docker Compose** and **Kubernetes with Helm Charts**
