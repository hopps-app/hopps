# Project-Specific Allowed Commands
# ==================================
# Location: {project_dir}/.autoforge/allowed_commands.yaml
#
# This file defines bash commands that the autonomous coding agent can use
# for THIS SPECIFIC PROJECT, beyond the default allowed commands.
#
# When you create a new project, AutoForge automatically creates this file
# in your project's .autoforge/ directory. You can customize it for your
# project's specific needs (iOS, Rust, Python, etc.).

version: 1

# Uncomment the commands you need for your specific project.
# By default, this file has NO commands enabled - you must explicitly add them.

  #   description: Project build script

  # - name: ./scripts/test.sh
  #   description: Run all project tests

  # - name: ./scripts/deploy-staging.sh
  #   description: Deploy to staging environment


# ==========================================
# Notes and Best Practices
# ==========================================
#
# Pattern Matching:
#   - Exact: "swift" matches only "swift"
#   - Wildcard: "swift*" matches "swift", "swiftc", "swiftlint", etc.
#   - Scripts: "./scripts/build.sh" matches the script by name
#
# Limits:
#   - Maximum 100 commands per project
#   - Commands in the blocklist (sudo, dd, shutdown, etc.) can NEVER be allowed
#   - Org-level blocked commands (see ~/.autoforge/config.yaml) cannot be overridden
#
# Default Allowed Commands (always available):
#   File operations: ls, cat, head, tail, wc, grep, cp, mkdir, mv, rm, touch
#   Shell: pwd, echo, sh, bash, sleep
#   Version control: git
#   Process management: ps, lsof, kill, pkill (dev processes only)
#   Network: curl
#   Node.js: npm, npx, pnpm, node
#   Docker: docker
#   chmod: Only +x mode (making scripts executable)
#
# Hardcoded Blocklist (NEVER allowed):
#   Disk operations: dd, mkfs, fdisk, parted
#   System control: shutdown, reboot, poweroff, halt, init
#   Privilege escalation: sudo, su, doas
#   System services: systemctl, service, launchctl
#   Network security: iptables, ufw
#   Ownership changes: chown, chgrp
#   Dangerous commands: aws, gcloud, az, kubectl (unless org allows)
