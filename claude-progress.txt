## Session Progress Notes

### Session 1 - Feature #81: AutoForge Branch & PR Workflow
**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Status:** COMPLETED - Feature marked as passing

**What was accomplished:**
- Modified `.autoforge/prompts/coding_prompt.md` to implement branch-based PR workflow
- Added "Create a Feature Branch (MANDATORY)" section after Step 3 (get feature)
  - Instructs agent to run `git checkout -b autoforge/feature-{id}-{short-name}`
  - Emphasizes all commits must go to feature branch, never directly to main
- Updated Step 7 from "COMMIT YOUR PROGRESS" to "COMMIT, PUSH BRANCH & CREATE PULL REQUEST"
  - Added branch push instructions with `git push -u origin`
  - Added PR creation template using `gh pr create` with structured body
  - Added PR rules (title must reference feature ID, body must include summary, base=main)
- Added `gh` CLI to `.autoforge/allowed_commands.yaml` for PR creation

**Verification:**
- Confirmed all 6 feature steps are satisfied
- Verified CI/CD workflows (backend.yml, frontend.yml, claude-code-review.yml) all support branch-based workflow
- Confirmed no heredocs used in PR creation command (compatible with sandbox mode)
- Reviewed complete diff to ensure clean changes

**Current completion:** 2/81 features passing (2.5%)

**Next steps:**
- Other features in the backlog need implementation
- The branch & PR workflow will be used by future coding agent sessions
