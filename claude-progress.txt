## Session Progress Notes

### Session 1 - Feature #81: AutoForge Branch & PR Workflow
**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Status:** COMPLETED - Feature marked as passing

**What was accomplished:**
- Modified `.autoforge/prompts/coding_prompt.md` to implement branch-based PR workflow
- Added "Create a Feature Branch (MANDATORY)" section after Step 3 (get feature)
  - Instructs agent to run `git checkout -b autoforge/feature-{id}-{short-name}`
  - Emphasizes all commits must go to feature branch, never directly to main
- Updated Step 7 from "COMMIT YOUR PROGRESS" to "COMMIT, PUSH BRANCH & CREATE PULL REQUEST"
  - Added branch push instructions with `git push -u origin`
  - Added PR creation template using `gh pr create` with structured body
  - Added PR rules (title must reference feature ID, body must include summary, base=main)
- Added `gh` CLI to `.autoforge/allowed_commands.yaml` for PR creation

**Verification:**
- Confirmed all 6 feature steps are satisfied
- Verified CI/CD workflows (backend.yml, frontend.yml, claude-code-review.yml) all support branch-based workflow
- Confirmed no heredocs used in PR creation command (compatible with sandbox mode)
- Reviewed complete diff to ensure clean changes

**Current completion:** 2/81 features passing (2.5%)

**Next steps:**
- Other features in the backlog need implementation
- The branch & PR workflow will be used by future coding agent sessions

### Session 2 - Feature #8: Landing page renders correctly
**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Status:** COMPLETED - Feature marked as passing

**What was accomplished:**
- Verified the existing landing page at `/` renders correctly without authentication
- All 5 verification steps confirmed:
  1. Root URL `/` loads without login - PASS
  2. Landing page content displayed (heading, description, CTA buttons, hero image) - PASS
  3. No authentication errors shown - PASS (only non-blocking dev tool warnings)
  4. Navigation to registration available via Register button → `/register` - PASS
  5. Page fully rendered with no stuck loading spinners - PASS
- No code changes required - existing implementation is fully functional
- Console errors analyzed: all are non-blocking (EmojiService network fetch, React Query Devtools locale issue)

**Current completion:** 7/81 features passing (8.6%)

**Next steps:**
- Continue with remaining Navigation Integrity and other features

### Session - Feature #10: Route guards block unauthenticated access
**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Status:** COMPLETED - Feature marked as passing

**What was accomplished:**
- Verified that all 5 protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to Keycloak login
- Tested each route by clearing all auth tokens/sessions and navigating directly:
  1. `/dashboard` -> Redirected to Keycloak login (redirect_uri=.../dashboard)
  2. `/structure` -> Redirected to Keycloak login (redirect_uri=.../structure)
  3. `/receipts/new` -> Redirected to Keycloak login (redirect_uri=.../receipts/new)
  4. `/admin/categories` -> Redirected to Keycloak login (redirect_uri=.../admin/categories)
  5. `/profile` -> Redirected to Keycloak login (redirect_uri=.../profile)
- Verified no protected content is briefly visible before redirect:
  - AuthGuard returns `null` while app initializing (no render)
  - AuthGuard returns `null` when unauthenticated (no render) then triggers Keycloak login
  - App.tsx returns `null` until `isInitialized` is true
  - Three-layer protection: App.tsx -> AuthGuard -> AuthLayout ensures zero content flash
  - Screenshots taken immediately after navigation show only blank page or Keycloak login
- No code changes required - existing AuthGuard and routing implementation is correct

**Current completion:** 13/81 features passing (16.0%)

**Next steps:**
- Continue with other features

### Session - Features #28, #29, #70: Transaction Pagination, Search, and Page Size
**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Status:** IN PROGRESS - Backend startup issues blocking verification

**What was accomplished:**
- **Feature #28 (Transaction Pagination):** Implemented pagination UI in ReceiptsList component
  - Added page state tracking with useState
  - Implemented handleNextPage and handlePreviousPage functions
  - Created pagination controls UI with Previous/Next buttons and page indicator
  - Added translations for pagination ("Previous", "Next", "Page X of Y")
  - Integrated with existing AG Grid for transaction display
- **Feature #70 (Test Data):** Started implementing test transaction data generation
  - Created TransactionDataLoader.java to generate test data on startup
  - Created TestdataConfig.java to enable/disable test data loading
  - Attempted to generate 50 test transactions with realistic data
- **Infrastructure Fixes:**
  - Fixed .env file with correct Keycloak configuration (port 8092, realm hopps, client_id hopps)
  - Formatted backend Java code with mvn formatter

**Challenges Encountered:**
- Backend fails to start due to TradeParty entity validation errors
- TransactionDataLoader missing required TradeParty fields (name, address, etc.)
- Cannot complete end-to-end testing without running backend
- Keycloak user provisioning not working correctly from registration endpoint

**Next steps to complete Feature #28:**
1. Fix TradeParty creation in TransactionDataLoader (add all required fields)
2. Wait for backend to start successfully with test transactions
3. Login via Keycloak and navigate to /receipts
4. Verify pagination controls are visible
5. Verify clicking "Next" loads next 10 transactions
6. Verify page indicator updates correctly
7. Mark feature #28 as passing
8. Then proceed to features #29 and #70 (search functionality)

**Files modified:**
- frontend/spa/src/components/Receipts/ReceiptsList.tsx
- frontend/spa/src/locales/en.json
- frontend/spa/src/locales/de.json
- frontend/spa/.env
- backend/app.hopps.org/src/main/resources/testdata/testdata.yaml
- backend/app.hopps.org/src/main/java/app/hopps/shared/bootstrap/TestdataConfig.java
- backend/app.hopps.org/src/main/java/app/hopps/shared/bootstrap/TransactionDataLoader.java (created)

**Current completion:** 19/81 features passing (23.5%)

### Session - Features #15, #17, #19: Bommel Management Features
**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Status:** Feature #17 IMPLEMENTED (delete confirmation dialog) - Features #15 and #19 already exist in codebase

**What was accomplished:**
- Analyzed assigned features #15 (Create child Bommel), #17 (Delete Bommel with confirmation), #19 (Tree view)
- Discovered Features #15 and #19 were already fully implemented in the codebase:
  - Feature #15: `createChildBommel` function in `useOrganizationTree.ts` (line 79-102)
  - Feature #19: `BommelTreeComponent` using react-d3-tree (fully functional tree visualization)
- **Implemented Feature #17: Delete Bommel Confirmation Dialog**
  - Created `DeleteBommelDialog.tsx` component with proper confirmation UI
  - Added transaction handling options (unlink vs reassign - reassign marked as "coming soon")
  - Created `RadioGroup.tsx` UI component for option selection
  - Updated `BommelCard.tsx` to use new dialog instead of window.confirm()
  - Added i18n translations for dialog in English and German
  - Dialog shows warning when Bommel has linked transactions
  - User must choose how to handle transactions before deleting
- Fixed backend formatting issues (TransactionDataLoader.java) with mvn formatter
- Updated `.env` file to fix Keycloak configuration (port 8092, realm hopps, client hopps)

**Technical Details:**
- DeleteBommelDialog props: open, bommelName, hasTransactions, onConfirm, onCancel
- Dialog shows transaction count and forces user to select handling method
- RadioGroup component created following shadcn/ui patterns with Radix UI primitives
- BommelCard now uses state `showDeleteDialog` and separate handlers for delete click vs confirm
- Translation keys added: hasTransactionsWarning, transactionHandlingLabel, unlinkOption, etc.

**Challenges Encountered:**
- Keycloak authentication issues prevented full end-to-end testing in browser
- User provisioning from registration endpoint not working properly
- Backend docker images not available, attempted local Quarkus dev mode
- File linter automatically reformatting changes during development

**Files Modified:**
- frontend/spa/src/components/BommelTreeView/components/BommelCard.tsx
- frontend/spa/src/locales/en.json
- frontend/spa/src/locales/de.json
- frontend/spa/.env (Keycloak config fix)
- backend/app.hopps.org/src/main/java/app/hopps/shared/bootstrap/TransactionDataLoader.java (formatting)

**Files Created:**
- frontend/spa/src/components/BommelTreeView/components/DeleteBommelDialog.tsx
- frontend/spa/src/components/ui/RadioGroup.tsx

**Current completion:** 19/81 features passing (23.5%)

**Next steps:**
- Need to complete full end-to-end verification of all three features once authentication is working
- Feature #17 dialog implemented but needs UI testing in browser
- Features #15 and #19 exist but need end-to-end verification with browser automation
- Backend API for delete currently doesn't support transaction handling parameter (future enhancement)
